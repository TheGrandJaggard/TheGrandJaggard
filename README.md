# Hi there👋 I'm Jaggard
- 🏢 I'm currently working part time at [FreightLogics](https://www.freightlogics.com) as a developer. With the rest of my time I'm learning and creating.
- 💡 My passion is Game Development, so that's why I've taken multiple online courses from [Gamedev.tv](https://www.gamedev.tv).
- 🌱 Whenever I can, I spend my time learning more about game systems, engines, and mechanics.
- 🧑‍💻 Recently I've been working on building out an entire inventory system (so much fun!).
- 🎮 I have published a few of my projects to [itch.io](https://jaggard.itch.io), where I also participated in the Gamedev.tv Game Jam 2024.
- ⚡ Fun fact: My profile picure is a Lynx.
